# What are templates

A template is a simple yet very powerful tool in C++. 

The simple idea is to <ins>pass the data type as a parameter</ins> so that we donâ€™t need to write the same code for different data types. 

For example, a software company may need to sort() for different data types. Rather than writing and maintaining multiple codes, we can write one sort() and pass the datatype as a parameter. 

C++ adds two new keywords to support templates: ````template```` and ```type name```. The second keyword can always be replaced by the keyword ```class```.

# How templates work

Templates are expanded at compiler time. This is like macros. 

The difference is, that the compiler does type-checking before template expansion. 

The idea is simple, source code contains only function/class, but compiled code may contain multiple copies of the same function/class.
